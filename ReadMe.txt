Donator.md is a website created using ASP.NET MVC technologies and the Business Logic pattern. 
There are 3 levels of access: user, medical center and admin. 
- Users can complete surveys expressing their agreement to be contacted by medical centers to donate 
blood in case of emergency and make appointments to donate blood. 
- Medical centers can search for donors by blood group and/or by address. Each medical center completes its table with blood 
resources, in order to be able, in case of necessity, to help another center. 
- Admin can edit users' personal data, add news to the page, block users, add new users. 
Users added by the administrator must change their password when logging in for the first time. 
- The password reset function is also implemented.
